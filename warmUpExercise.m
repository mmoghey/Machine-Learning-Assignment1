% ============= YOUR CODE HERE ==============
% Instructions: Return a 5x5 matrix of ones
%               In octave, we return values by defining which variables
%               represent the return values (at the top of the file)
%               and then set them accordingly. 
% Hint: This exercise is pretty straightforward, all you need to do is 
% adding "A = ones(5);" in the blank area below.  

A =ones(5);
